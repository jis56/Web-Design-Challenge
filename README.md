# Web-Design-Challenge
----

Latitude Analysis Dashboard: A dashboard website was created using the visualizations created from the Python API challenge (https://github.com/jis56/Python-API-Challenge). In building this dashboard, individual pages were created for each plot with explanations as well as a means to navigate between each of them. Additionally, a landing page, a comparison page, and a data page were also created.

In total, the webiste consists of 7 pages:

* A landing page containing:

  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.


* Four visualization pages, each with:

  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  - A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


A "Comparisons" page that:

Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.




A "Data" page that:

Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The table must be a bootstrap table component. Hint

The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. Try using a tool you already know, pandas. Pandas has a nifty method approprately called to_html that allows you to generate a HTML table from a pandas dataframe. See the documentation here
